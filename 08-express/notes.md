# Express notes

## 340. Introducing Express

- Express helps us...
  - Start up a server to listen for requests
  - Parse incoming requests and match those requests with particular routes
  - Craft an `http` response and its content
- Libraries vs. Frameworks
  - Library
    - You're in control
    - You decide when to integrate a library into your code
  - Framework
    - Control is inverted
    - Frameworks provide a structure for an application
    - You write code according to the rules of the framework
    - Frameworks are generally for full applications

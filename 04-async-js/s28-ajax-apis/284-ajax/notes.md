# AJAX

- Asynchronous JavaScript And XML (AJAX)
- Send and receive data from a server asynchronously (in the background) behind the scenes (without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page)
- AJAX allows web pages and apps to dynamically change content without the need to reload the entire page.
